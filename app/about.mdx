I'm a software engineer based in Colorado. I'm currently working at [Viget](https://www.viget.com).

I build UI components for sites and multi million dollar web applications in collaboration with other developers and or independently. I take high fidelity designs and developing them into large design systems that can be used throughout the application.

I develop interactive UI components that meet accessibility standards WCAG. I collaborate with stakeholders to gather feedback, refine requirements, and align on project goals. I ensure that the UI components effectively meet the needs of both users and business objectives. I'm a quick learner and I'm always looking for new challenges.
