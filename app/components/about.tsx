        I build UI components for websites and large-scale web applications,
        working both solo and with other developers. I take detailed designs and
        turn them into comprehensive design systems that scale across entire
        applications. My components are interactive and meet WCAG accessibility
        standards. I work closely with stakeholders to get feedback, refine
        requirements, and make sure we're all on the same page. The goal is
        always to create UI components that work great for users while hitting
        the business targets too.
