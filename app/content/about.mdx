I'm a web developer based in Colorado. I'm currently working at [Viget](https://www.viget.com).

With a background in design and over 12+ years in the marketing industry, I have a deep understanding of web development.
Over my career I have built large multi million dollar web applications and high impact
websites. I have lead frontend development from initial planning and design to production and maintenance.
I enjoy learning new skills, love the outdoors, and always looking for new challenges.
