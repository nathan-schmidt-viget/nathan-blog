I'm a software engineer based in Colorado. I'm currently working at [Viget](https://www.viget.com).

After starting my career as a web designer, I quickly found that I really enjoyed building UI interfaces.
I have built UI interfaces ranging from startup to multi million dollar web applications.
I enjoy learning new skills, love the outdoors, and always looking for new challenges.
